# SGA_Phages

Code and metadata files used for "Host translation machinery is not a barrier to phages that infect both CPR and non-CPR bacteria" (Liu et al., 2022)

# Notebooks (*.ipynb)

Final_SGA_CRISPR_Cas.ipynb: Code used to profile Saccharibacteria, Gracilibacteria, and Absconditabacteria CRISPR-Cas systems and extract spacers. 
  
Final_SGA_phages.ipynb: Code used to search for Saccharibacteria, Gracilibacteria, and Absconditabacteria phages. Additionally includes code used to characterize and profile the host range of identified phages.  
  
Several external databases and files are required including: IMG/VR (Roux et al., 2021), OVD (Li et al., 2022), NCBI nr (Sayers et al., 2021), GVD (Gregory et al., 2020), pVOG (Grazziontin et al., 2017), Earth Virome Phages (Paez-Espino et al. 2016), vContact2 (Bin Jang et al., 2019). 
  
Genomes, proteins, and associated metadata are available in the associated Zenodo repository:
